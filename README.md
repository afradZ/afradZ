- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @afradZ



Welcome to my GitHub repository! As a software engineering student, I've created this space to share my projects and showcase my skills.

Here you'll find a collection of code examples, projects, and other resources related to software engineering. I'll be updating this repository regularly as I continue to learn and grow as a developer.

Feel free to explore the code and projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback. I'm always looking for ways to improve, so your input is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository, and happy coding!
